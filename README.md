### Fangzhou Yu

## Goal
Given an unsorted array as input, use bubble sort algorithm to sort the array within the circuit implemented using halo2.

## Assumptions
We know the length of array beforehand.\

## Current problems
Circuit Issues:
- Some cells not assigned
- Soem cells have value zero, weirdly
